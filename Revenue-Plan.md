**II. Revenue & Profit Sharing Model**:

1. **Sponsorships**:
   - Aim for a baseline sponsorship deal of $1,000/episode initially.
   - As viewership grows, re-negotiate rates.

2. **Merchandise Sales** (if you choose to sell merchandise):
   - Aim for a net profit of $10 per item sold after production costs.

3. **Additional Revenue Streams**:
   - YouTube Ad Revenue, Patreon or Member Subscriptions, Affiliate Marketing (promoting hiking/climbing gear, etc.)

---

**III. Profit Sharing**:

1. **Production Cost Deduction**:
   - Deduct all episode-specific costs from the sponsorship and other revenue for each episode.

2. **Revenue Sharing Model**:
   - **Cameron Griffin** (Host, Producer, Sound Engineer, Assistant Visual Director, Editor): 40%
   - **James Pluid** (Sound & Camera, Show Planning, Production): 30%
   - **Future Creators/Investors**: 
     - Fixed 20% to be divided amongst all (can be adjusted based on the number and contribution of creators/investors)
   - **Reinvestment Fund**: 10% (for equipment upgrades, marketing boosts, etc.)

**Example**: If an episode makes $1,200 from sponsorships, after deducting production costs ($600 estimated), the profit is $600. Based on the sharing model:
- Cameron gets $240
- James receives $180
- Other creators/investors split $120
- $60 goes into the reinvestment fund

---

**Notes**:
- Always maintain clear financial records and agreements.
- Regularly review the budget and adjust as necessary based on actual expenses and revenues.
- As the show grows and secures consistent revenues, consider hiring an accountant or financial consultant for more detailed financial planning and management.
