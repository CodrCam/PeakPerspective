#  Backup Plan for "Peak Perspective": Physical Drives and Adobe Cloud Services

---

**Objective:**  
Ensure all data, including raw footage, audio files, edited content, and other related files, is safely backed up, minimizing the risk of data loss.

---

#### **I. Physical Drive Backup Protocol**

**1. Primary Drive:**  
After each shoot, transfer all raw footage and audio files immediately to a designated primary external hard drive.

**2. Secondary Drive (Backup):**  
- Duplicate all data from the primary drive to a secondary external hard drive. This ensures redundancy in the backup process.
- Store this drive in a separate location from the primary to safeguard against potential physical damages or theft.

**3. Tertiary Drive (Monthly Archive):**  
- At the end of each month, transfer all data from the primary drive to a separate archival hard drive.
- Label this drive with the month and year for easy retrieval.

**4. Drive Maintenance:**  
- Regularly inspect and test all physical drives to ensure they're in working condition.
- Consider using drives with built-in encryption for added security.

#### **II. Adobe Cloud Services Backup Protocol**

**1. Initial Setup:**  
- Set up an organized folder structure in Adobe Creative Cloud, specific to "Peak Perspective."
- Use clear naming conventions for folders, such as "Raw_Footage_MM_YYYY," "Edited_Episodes_MM_YYYY," and "Audio_Files_MM_YYYY."

**2. Daily Backup:**  
- After transferring data to the primary physical drive, upload the same data to the designated Adobe Cloud folder.
- Ensure a stable internet connection for uninterrupted uploads.

**3. Versioning:**  
- Utilize Adobe Cloud's versioning capabilities. This ensures that multiple versions of edited files can be retrieved if necessary.
- Label versions appropriately, such as "Episode01_v1," "Episode01_v2," etc.

**4. Shared Access:**  
- Grant access to key team members, ensuring they can access, edit, or add files as needed.
- Use Adobe's collaboration tools for real-time feedback and edits without the need for redundant file transfers.

**5. Periodic Cloud Cleanup:**  
- Every six months, review files in the cloud and archive older files to streamline the workspace.
- Ensure you still maintain two physical copies of any files you decide to remove from the cloud.

#### **III. General Best Practices**

**1. Regular Checks:**  
Perform weekly checks to ensure that all data has been backed up in both physical drives and the cloud.

**2. Update & Maintenance:**  
Regularly update software to ensure compatibility and security. This includes the operating systems of devices used for transfer, Adobe software, and firmware of the physical drives.

**3. Training:**  
Ensure that everyone involved in the data transfer and backup process is adequately trained and aware of the backup protocols.

**4. Notification System:**  
Set up notifications/alerts, especially for cloud storage, to get updates on storage limits, successful uploads, or any issues.
