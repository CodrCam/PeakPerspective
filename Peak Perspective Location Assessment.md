#  Peak Perspective: Location Assessment 

**1. Hiking Location Assessment:**

**Safety Assessment:**

- **Trail Selection:**
  * Research trail reviews and ratings.
  * Consider trail length â€“ not too short, so conversations aren't rushed, but not overly long to exhaust the guest.
  * Check if the trail has clear markings or requires a guide.
  
- **Wildlife Presence:** 
  * If hiking in bear or snake country, carry repellents or bells and educate the guest and crew on how to react during encounters.
  * Avoid areas with a recent history of aggressive animal encounters.
  
- **Weather Conditions:**
  * Use reliable sources for weather forecasts.
  * Have rain gear and protective clothing on hand if necessary.
  
- **Altitude Assessment:** 
  * If the guest isn't acclimatized, avoid high altitudes or factor in acclimatization days.

**Shot Selection & Vision:**

- **Scouting:** 
  * Prioritize trails with varied landscapes (woods, viewpoints, waterscapes).
  * Take pre-hike trips to shortlist exact shooting spots.
  
- **Timings:** 
  * If the trail is popular, opt for dawn or dusk hikes for fewer interruptions and better lighting.
